# Documentation for Trucker Profile Update System

## Overview
This documentation provides an overview of the trucker profile update system, including the key components, request handling, and database interactions.

## Key Components

### 1. Frontend (React)
- **TruckerProfile Component**: This component allows users to view and edit their profile information.
  - **State Management**: Uses React's `useState` to manage form data and error messages.
  - **Form Submission**: The `handleSubmit` function handles form submission, validates input, and sends a PUT request to update the profile.

### 2. Backend (Node.js/Express)
- **Controller**: The `registerController.js` file contains the logic for handling trucker registration and updates.
  - **updateTrucker Function**: This function updates the trucker's information in the database.
    - It checks for the presence of fields (firstName, lastName, email, phone, password, accountType) in the request body.
    - It hashes the password if provided and updates the trucker record in the database.

## Request Handling
- **PUT Request**: The frontend sends a PUT request to update the trucker profile.
  - **Endpoint**: `/api/trucker/profile/:userId`
  - **Headers**: Includes an authorization token in the headers.
  - **Body**: Contains the updated profile information in FormData format.

## Database Interaction
- **MongoDB**: The application uses MongoDB to store trucker information.
  - **Model**: The `truckerModel.js` defines the schema for trucker data.
  - **Update Logic**: The `findByIdAndUpdate` method is used to update the trucker record in the database.

## Error Handling
- The application includes error handling for various scenarios, such as:
  - Missing required fields.
  - Existing email or phone number conflicts.
  - Database errors during the update process.
